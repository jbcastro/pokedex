Dear Hiring Manager, 

My name is Joseph and I am writing to apply for the Jr. Web Developer position at Health Plus Life CBD. I recently finished a Database Programming and Development certificate at Seattle Central however as a part of that program I also worked on Web Scripting and Development and I found a have a passion for the web.   

During my time at Seattle Central I leaned and used HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, NodeJS, jQuery, Git, .NET, C#, React, and of course SQL Server while using Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code.  I have made various websites from scratch using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery plugins with Media Queries as well as MERN stacks with NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB including APIs. Less than 9 months ago I knew next to nothing about web development however I have learned a lot and fast because I have a passion for it and find it extremely interesting and enveloping and am eager to learn new skills and technologies. 

In addition to my technical skills I would be a great candidate because of my great people skills and ability to work with others. My working career I have worked directly with people, whether it be a part of a team in a restaurant setting or working individually directly with clients/patients in both tech support and health care. With each of these roles I have had to communicate directly with people in various roles, from doctors to chefs to management to support staff.  

With my combination of technical, people, and communication skills as well as my passion for web development I am confident I’d make a great fit for this position. Thank you for taking the time to review my application and consider me as a candidate. I can be reached at 415.669.4898 or at josephbeckcastro@gmail.com and I hope to hear from you soon. 

 

Respectfully, 

Joseph Beck Castro
