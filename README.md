This project started from this tutorial https://blog.cloudboost.io/lets-build-a-pokedex-with-react-part-1-e1ba0b9387a7 In that tutorial Juan Diego Jimenez set up a Pokedex that would show sprites of the Gen 1 Pokemon. When a Pokemon was clicked it would get a picture, the Dex number, the name, and the type of selected Pokemon.

Featues I have added

-Shiny button. A button that would toggle between normal and shiny version of selected pokemon

-Type component. A component of the right that shows filtered pokemon based on type. For instance if one would choose electric it would show all electric Pokemon, and the type it is weak against (for electric it is ground)

-Type buttons. When a Pokemon is selected buttons would pop up of that Pokemon's type, changing the type component

-Type dropdown. Will let one choose what type they would like to see in the type component

-Moves list. A dropdown that shows all the moves that the selected Pokemon can possess

In addition I have filtered all this to Gen 1 pokemon only since the PokeAPI is up to 964!

Prior to this the only React project I had done was a basic MERN stack for school. It functioned (mostly...)
